**I am a programmer, hacker, cat lover, and a lot of things in between. I love to see how things work on the inside, code some really remarkable things, manipiate computer code to my likeing and make programs that do that for me!** ðŸ˜¼

**Besides doing all that cool stuff, I make techno music, study the universe and read books with my cat.**
